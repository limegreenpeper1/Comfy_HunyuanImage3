## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- ComfyUI installed and working
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- **Minimum 24GB VRAM** for NF4 quantized model
- **Minimum 80GB VRAM** (or multi-GPU) for full BF16 model
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 2.7+ with CUDA 12.8+

### System Requirements & Hardware Recommendations

The hardware requirements depend heavily on which model version you use.

#### 1. Full BF16 Model (Original)
This is the uncompressed 80B parameter model. It is massive.
- **Model Size**: ~160GB on disk.
- **VRAM**: 
  - **Ideal**: 80GB+ (A100, H100, RTX 6000 Ada). Runs entirely on GPU.
  - **Minimum**: 24GB (RTX 3090/4090). *Requires massive System RAM.*
- **System RAM (CPU Memory)**:
  - If you have <80GB VRAM, the model weights that don't fit on GPU are stored in RAM.
  - **Requirement**: **192GB+ System RAM** is recommended if using a 24GB card.
  - *Example*: On a 24GB card, ~140GB of weights will live in RAM.
- **Performance**:
  - On low VRAM cards, generation will be slow due to swapping data between RAM and VRAM.

#### 2. NF4 Quantized Model (Recommended)
This version is compressed to 4-bit, reducing size by ~4x with minimal quality loss.
- **Model Size**: ~45GB on disk.
- **VRAM**:
  - **Ideal**: 48GB+ (RTX 6000, A6000). Runs entirely on GPU.
  - **Minimum**: 24GB (RTX 3090/4090).
    - *Note*: Since 45GB > 24GB, about half the model will live in System RAM.
    - **Performance**: Slower than 48GB cards, but functional.
- **System RAM**: 
  - **64GB+ recommended** (especially for 24GB VRAM cards to hold the offloaded weights).
- **Performance**: Much faster on consumer hardware.

#### 3. INT8 Quantized Model (High Quality)

> ⚠️ **Warning**: INT8 loader is currently non-functional due to bitsandbytes validation issues when CPU offload is required. The INT8 quantization format does not save quantized weights to disk - it only saves metadata and re-quantizes on load, which triggers validation errors for large models requiring CPU offload. **Use NF4 or BF16 loaders instead.**

This version is compressed to 8-bit, offering near-original quality with reduced memory usage.
- **Model Size**: ~85GB on disk.
- **VRAM**:
  - **Ideal**: 80GB+ (A100, H100). Runs entirely on GPU.
  - **Minimum**: 24GB (RTX 3090/4090).
    - *Note*: Significant CPU offloading required (~60GB of weights in RAM).
- **System RAM**: 
  - **128GB+ recommended**.
- **Performance**: 
  - **Quality**: ~98% of full precision (better than NF4).
  - **Speed**: Faster inference than NF4 (less dequantization overhead) but requires more memory transfer if offloading.
  - **Practical Requirement**: For the selective INT8 checkpoints shipped here, you realistically need a 96GB-class GPU (RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell, H100, etc.). Forcing CPU offload on smaller cards makes each step take minutes because the quantized tensors continually stream over PCIe.

## 🚀 Usage

### 📸 Low VRAM Workflow Reference

![Low VRAM Workflow](Docs/LowVRAM-Workflow-Image.png)

Pair **Hunyuan 3 Loader (NF4 Low VRAM+)** with **Hunyuan 3 Generate (Low VRAM Budget)** for 24‑32 GB cards. The loader’s GPU budget slider keeps 18–20 GB free for inference while the generator adds smart telemetry and optional prompt rewriting. The screenshot above shows a full working chain (loader → rewriter → Low VRAM Budget generator → save/display) producing a 1600×1600 render on a 24 GB test rig without triggering bitsandbytes validation.

> 🆕 **Budget/Telemetry Nodes**: New loader/generator variants keep the legacy nodes untouched while exposing GPU budget sliders, smarter "smart" mode logic, and MemoryTracker telemetry in the node status. Mix and match them only if you need the extra controls; existing workflows can stay on the classic nodes.

### INT8 Budget Workflow Controls

When using the **Hunyuan 3 Loader (INT8 Budget)** + **Hunyuan 3 Generate (Large Budget)** path (recommended for 96 GB RTX 6000 Pro / similar cards), keep these controls in mind:

- `reserve_memory_gb` (loader): Amount of VRAM the loader leaves free for inference overhead. Set to ~20 GB for 1.5–2 MP work; increase when targeting 4K+ so Smart mode has headroom without forcing CPU offload.
- `gpu_memory_target_gb` (loader): How much VRAM the INT8 weights are allowed to occupy. 80 GB is a good sweet spot on 96 GB GPUs. Lower values keep more VRAM free but may require CPU spillover during load.
- `offload_mode` (Large Budget generator):
  - `smart` (default) reads the loader’s reserve/budget metadata, estimates per-megapixel cost (~15 GB/MP + 6 GB), and only enables accelerate CPU offload when VRAM is critically low.
  - `disabled` forces fully-on-GPU sampling (fastest) – use this for ≤2 MP jobs when you already fit in VRAM.
  - `always` moves the model into accelerate offload before sampling. Only select this for extreme resolutions where you expect to exceed available VRAM; otherwise it slows INT8 inference to CPU speeds.
- `keep_model_loaded` (Large Budget generator): When `False`, the node calls the same cache-clearing logic as **Hunyuan 3 Unload** after a run, freeing the INT8 weights from VRAM/RAM. Leave it `True` for iterative workflows to avoid reload times.
- `gpu_budget_gb` override (Large Budget generator): Temporarily overrides the loader’s `_loader_gpu_budget_gb` value for Smart-mode math without remapping tensors. Set it if you want Smart mode to assume a different baseline (e.g., 65 GB) without reloading the model; leave at `-1` to use the loader’s recorded budget.

These generator settings never remap the model by themselves—they only influence whether accelerate offload engages and whether we clear the cached model afterward. Adjust the loader slider first (20 GB reserve / 80 GB target recommended), then use the generator controls to decide when to keep models in memory or trigger CPU offload for very large renders.

### Node Compatibility Guide

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Match the Loader to the correct Generate node for stability.

| Loader Node | Compatible Generate Node | Why? |
|-------------|--------------------------|------|
| **Hunyuan 3 Loader (NF4)** | **Hunyuan 3 Generate** | Keeps model on GPU. Best for standard sizes (<2MP). |
| **Hunyuan 3 Loader (Full BF16)** | **Hunyuan 3 Generate (Large/Offload)** | Keeps model in RAM. Allows CPU offloading for massive images (4K+). |

> **Do not mix them!** Using the NF4 Loader with the Large/Offload node will likely cause errors because the quantized model cannot be moved to CPU correctly.

### Basic Workflow

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Hunyuan 3 Loader (NF4)  │
│  model_name: HunyuanImage-3-NF4 │
│  keep_in_cache: True    │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │ HUNYUAN_MODEL
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐

### Advanced: Prompt Rewriting

**✨ Feature**: Uses official HunyuanImage-3.0 system prompts to professionally expand your prompts for better results.

**⚠️ Note**: Requires a paid LLM API. This feature is optional - you can use the nodes without it.

**Supported APIs** (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint):
- DeepSeek (default, recommended for cost)
- OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-3.5
- Claude (via OpenAI-compatible proxy)
- Local LLMs (via LM Studio, Ollama with OpenAI API)

**Setup (Secure)**:
1. Rename `api_config.ini.example` to `api_config.ini` in the custom node folder.
2. Add your API key to the file:
   ```ini
   [API]
   api_key = sk-your-key-here
   ```
3. Alternatively, set environment variables: `HUNYUAN_API_KEY`, `HUNYUAN_API_URL`.

**Usage**:
- **Option 1 (Integrated)**: Enable `enable_prompt_rewrite` in the Generate node.
- **Option 2 (Standalone)**: Use the **Hunyuan Prompt Rewriter** node to rewrite prompts before passing them to any model.

```
┌─────────────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Hunyuan Prompt Rewriter │      │ Hunyuan 3 Generate      │
│  prompt: "dog running"  │ ───► │  prompt: (rewritten)    │
│  rewrite_style: ...     │      │  ...                    │
└─────────────────────────┘      └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Result**: Automatically expands to:
> "An energetic brown and white border collie running across a sun-drenched meadow filled with wildflowers, motion blur on legs showing speed, golden hour lighting, shallow depth of field, professional photography, high detail, 8k quality"

### Large Image Generation

For high-resolution outputs (2K, 4K, 6MP+):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Hunyuan 3 Generate (Large)      │
│  resolution: 3840x2160 - 4K UHD │
│  cpu_offload: True              │
│  steps: 50                      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📐 Resolution Guide

**Tip**: Test prompts at small resolutions (fast), then render finals in large node.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Memory Management

**Single GPU (24-48GB VRAM):**
```
Use: Hunyuan 3 Loader (NF4)
Settings:
  - keep_in_cache: True (for multiple generations)
  - Use standard Generate node for <2MP
```

**Single GPU (80-96GB VRAM):**
```
Use: Hunyuan 3 Loader (88GB GPU Optimized)
Settings:
  - reserve_memory_gb: 14.0 (leaves room for inference)
  - Full BF16 quality
```

**Multi-GPU Setup:**
```
Use: Hunyuan 3 Loader (Multi-GPU BF16)
Settings:
  - primary_gpu: 0 (where inference runs)
  - reserve_memory_gb: 12.0
  - Automatically distributes across all GPUs
```

### ⚡ Performance Optimization Guide

To get the maximum speed and avoid unnecessary offloading (which slows down generation):

1.  **Reserve Enough VRAM**:
    *   Use the `reserve_memory_gb` slider in the Loader.
    *   Set it high enough to cover the generation overhead for your target resolution (e.g., **30GB+ for 4K**).
    *   *Why?* If you reserve space upfront, the model stays on the GPU. If you don't, the "Smart Offload" might panic and move everything to RAM to prevent a crash.

2.  **Select Specific Resolutions**:
    *   Avoid using "Auto (model default)" in the Large Generate node if you are optimizing for speed.
    *   **Auto Mode Safety**: When "Auto" is selected, the node assumes a large resolution (~2.5MP) to be safe. This might trigger offloading even if your actual image is small.
    *   **Specific Mode**: Selecting "1024x1024" tells the node *exactly* how much VRAM is needed, allowing it to skip offload if you have the space.

### LLM Prompt Rewriting (Optional)

```

**Result**: Automatically expands to:
> "An energetic brown and white border collie running across a sun-drenched meadow filled with wildflowers, motion blur on legs showing speed, golden hour lighting, shallow depth of field, professional photography, high detail, 8k quality"

**Rewrite Styles** (Official HunyuanImage-3.0 system prompts):
- **none**: (Default) Use your original prompt without modification
- **en_recaption**: Structured professional expansion with detailed descriptions (recommended)
  - Adds objective, physics-consistent details
  - Enhances lighting, composition, color descriptions
  - Best for general use
- **en_think_recaption**: Advanced mode with thinking phase + detailed expansion
  - LLM analyzes your intent first, then creates detailed prompt
  - More comprehensive but uses more tokens
  - Best for complex or ambiguous prompts

**Example Results**:
```
Original: "a cat on a table"

en_recaption: "A domestic short-hair cat with orange and white fur sits 
upright on a wooden dining table. Soft afternoon sunlight streams through 
a nearby window, casting warm highlights on the cat's fur and creating 
gentle shadows on the table surface. The background shows a blurred 
kitchen interior with neutral tones. Ultra-realistic, photographic style, 
sharp focus on the cat, shallow depth of field, 8k resolution."
```

If you get a "402 Payment Required" error, add credits to your API account or disable prompt rewriting.

## 🛠️ Quantization

Create your own NF4 quantized model:

```bash
cd quantization
python hunyuan_quantize_nf4.py \
  --model-path "/path/to/HunyuanImage-3" \
  --output-path "/path/to/HunyuanImage-3-NF4"
```

**Benefits:**
- ~4x smaller (80GB → 20GB model size)
- ~45GB VRAM usage (vs 80GB+ for BF16)
- Minimal quality loss
- Attention layers kept in full precision for stability

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

**RTX 6000 Ada (48GB) - NF4 Quantized:**
- Load time: ~35 seconds
- 1024x1024 @ 50 steps: ~4 seconds/step
- VRAM usage: ~45GB

**2x RTX 4090 (48GB each) - Multi-GPU BF16:**
- Load time: ~60 seconds
- 1024x1024 @ 50 steps: ~3.5 seconds/step
- VRAM usage: ~70GB + 10GB distributed

**RTX 6000 Blackwell (96GB) - Full BF16:**
- Load time: ~25 seconds
- 1024x1024 @ 50 steps: ~3 seconds/step
- VRAM usage: ~80GB

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory Errors

**Solutions:**
1. Use NF4 quantized model instead of full BF16
2. Reduce resolution (pick options marked `[<2MP]`)
3. Lower `steps` (try 30-40 instead of 50)
4. Use "Hunyuan 3 Generate (Large/Offload)" node with `cpu_offload: True`
5. Run "Hunyuan 3 Unload" node before generating
6. Set `keep_in_cache: False` in loader

### Pixelated/Corrupted Output

**If using NF4 quantization:**
- Re-quantize with the updated script (includes attention layer fix)
- Old quantized models may produce artifacts

### Multi-GPU Not Detecting Second GPU

**Check:**
1. Run "Hunyuan 3 GPU Info" node
2. Look for `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable
3. Ensure ComfyUI can see all GPUs: `torch.cuda.device_count()`

**Fix:**
```bash
# Remove GPU visibility restrictions
unset CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
# Restart ComfyUI
```

### Slow Generation

**Optimizations:**
1. Use NF4 quantized model (faster than BF16)
2. Reduce `steps` (30-40 is often sufficient)
3. Keep model in cache (`keep_in_cache: True`)
4. Use smaller resolutions for testing

## 📝 Advanced Tips

### Prompt Engineering

**Good prompts include:**
1. **Subject**: What is the main focus
2. **Action**: What is happening
3. **Environment**: Where it takes place
4. **Style**: Artistic style, mood, atmosphere
5. **Technical**: Lighting, composition, quality keywords

**Example:**
```
A majestic snow leopard prowling through a misty mountain forest at dawn,
dappled golden light filtering through pine trees, shallow depth of field,
wildlife photography, National Geographic style, 8k, highly detailed fur texture
```

**Note**: HunyuanImage-3.0 uses an autoregressive architecture (like GPT) rather than diffusion, so it doesn't support negative prompts. Instead, be explicit in your prompt about what you want to include.

### Reproducible Results

Set a specific seed (0-18446744073709551615) to get the same image:
