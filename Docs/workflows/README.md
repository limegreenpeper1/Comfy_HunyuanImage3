# Workflow Library

Each workflow lives in its own subfolder under `Docs/workflows/<name>/` with the following structure:

```text
<name>/
  workflow.json        # exported ComfyUI workflow
  README.md            # overview, hardware requirements, node list
  thumb.png (optional) # screenshot of the node graph
```

Feel free to drop raw exports/screenshots here and I can help format the README later.
